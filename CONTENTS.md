1. armstrong.txt      - C program to check whether a given number is an armstrong number or not.
                        Armstrong number = When the sum of the cube of the individual digits of a number is equal to that number.
                          Example - 153 -> 1^3 +5^3 + 3^3 = 153.

2. calculator.txt     - C program to implement a Calculator using Switch Case.

3. fibonacci.txt      - C program to check whether a given number is a fibonacci number or not.
                        Fibonacci - The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following sequence:
                             0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,....
                        The sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation, Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 where F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.

4. palindrome.txt     - C program to check whether a number is palindrome or not.
                        Palindrome - An integer is a palindrome if the reverse of that number is equal to the original number.
                          Example - 252 -> reversing -> 252.

5. pyramidofstars.txt - C program to print pyramid of stars.

6. strong.txt         - C program to check whether the number is strong or not.
                        Strong Number - Strong number is a special number whose sum of factorial of digits is equal to the original number.
                          Example -  145 -> 1! + 4! + 5! = 145
